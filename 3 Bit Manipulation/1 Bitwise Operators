UNSIGNED NUMBERS := Only Positive numbers i.e from 0 to some maximum
SIGNED NUMBERS := Negative minimum to some positive maximum.
                                      These are represented using  2's complement.
For positive number --> decimal to binary converison
For negative number -->represent as 2's complement

Eg:- Representing -2 in 2's complement

        for 3 bits ===> 23 - 2 = 6 ==>1 1 0
        for 32 bits ===> 232 - 2

Eg:- Representing 2 in 2's complement
         0  1 0  normal decimal to binary conversion

Eg:- Representing -3 in 2's complement

        for 3 bits ===> 23 - 3 = 5 ==>1 0 1

Eg:- Representing -4 in 2's complement

        for 3 bits ===> 23 - 4 = 4 ==>1 0 0 


BITWISE OPERATORS : -
